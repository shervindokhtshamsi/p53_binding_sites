Project Name: p53 Binding Site Predictor - Educational Project 

Description and Disclaimer:
The p53 Binding Site Predictor - Educational Project is a result of an educational endeavor for a data analysis and machine learning class. This project focuses on predicting p53 binding sites in DNA sequences using machine learning techniques. It is essential to emphasize that this project is purely for educational purposes and should not be utilized or deployed in real-world scenarios.

Data Sources:

Binding Sites Data: Binding site data for p53 was obtained from the JASPAR database at http://jaspar.genereg.net/.
Non-Binding Sites Data: Non-binding site data for p53 was obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/.

Installation:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/shervindokhtshamsi/p53_binding_sites.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd p53-binding-predictor
Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
